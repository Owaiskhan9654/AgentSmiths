The component should also include an order submission form that allows users to submit their order (with their name and phone number) for pickup or delivery. The form should not allow users to select a specific time for pickup or delivery. The form should be handled by a React component, collecting user name and phone number and sending this data to the backend API.

## Honda Hitha Hotels Ordering App Specification

### Overall Description and Goals

The application will allow users to order food from Honda Hitha Hotels. The app should be user-friendly and allow customers to easily browse the menu, select items, and place orders.

### Features

* **Browse Menu:** Users should be able to view the menu, categorized by food type (e.g., pizzas, appetizers, drinks). Each item should have a description, price, and possibly an image.
* **Add Items to Cart:** Users should be able to add items to their cart, with the ability to adjust quantities.
* **View Cart:** Users should be able to view their cart, see the total cost, and modify items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, providing their contact information and delivery address.
* **Order Tracking:** Users should be able to track the status of their order (e.g., order placed, preparing, out for delivery, delivered).

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **User opens the app.**
2.  **User browses the menu.**
3.  **User adds items to their cart.**
4.  **User views their cart and modifies items if needed.**
5.  **User proceeds to checkout.**
6.  **User provides contact information and delivery address.**
7.  **User places the order.**
8.  **User receives order confirmation.**
9.  **User can track the status of their order.**

#### Application Parts

* **Menu Page:** Displays the menu, categorized by food type. Each item should have a description, price, and possibly an image. Users should be able to add items to their cart from this page.
* **Cart Page:** Displays the items in the user's cart, with the ability to adjust quantities and remove items. The page should also display the total cost of the order.
* **Checkout Page:** Allows users to provide their contact information and delivery address. The page should also display the order summary and total cost.
* **Order Tracking Page:** Displays the status of the user's order. The page should update in real-time as the order progresses.

### Technical Specification

#### Application Type

Web application using the React framework with Styled Components for styling.

#### Architecture

* **Frontend:** React with Styled Components.
* **Backend:** (To be determined - could be Node.js with Express or a similar framework, or a serverless solution like AWS Lambda)
* **Database:** (To be determined - could be MongoDB or a similar NoSQL database, or a relational database like PostgreSQL)

#### Components

* **Menu Component:** Displays the menu items, categorized by food type. It should fetch data from the backend and render it dynamically.
* **Cart Component:** Manages the user's cart, allowing them to add, remove, and modify items. It should communicate with the backend to update the cart data.
* **Checkout Component:** Handles the checkout process, collecting user information and submitting the order to the backend.
* **Order Tracking Component:** Fetches order status updates from the backend and displays them to the user.

### Integration Specification

* **Backend API:** The frontend will communicate with a backend API to fetch menu data, manage the cart, process orders, and retrieve order status updates. The API should be designed to handle requests from the frontend and interact with the database.
* **Payment Gateway:** (To be determined - could be Stripe, PayPal, or a similar service) The application will need to integrate with a payment gateway to process payments securely.
* **Delivery Service:** (To be determined - could be a third-party delivery service like DoorDash, Uber Eats, or a custom delivery system) The application will need to integrate with a delivery service to handle order fulfillment and tracking.

### Additional Notes

* The application should be responsive and work on different screen sizes.
* The application should be secure and protect user data.
* The application should be easy to use and navigate.
* The application should be visually appealing and consistent with the Honda Hitha Hotels brand.

## Food Ordering App Specification

### Overall Description and Goals

The application is a web-based food ordering platform for your restaurant. Users will be able to browse your menu, select items, and place orders for pickup or delivery.

### Features

* **Browse Menu:** Users can view your restaurant's menu, categorized by food type (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts). Each menu item should display its name, description, price, and optionally an image.
* **Add to Cart:** Users can add items to their cart by clicking on a button or icon next to each item.
* **View Cart:** Users can view their cart, modify quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users can proceed to checkout, where they can enter their contact information, delivery address (if applicable), and payment details.
* **Order Confirmation:** After placing an order, users receive an order confirmation with details about their order, including order number, total price, and estimated delivery time (if applicable).
* **Order Tracking:** Users can track the status of their order (e.g., preparing, out for delivery, delivered).

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1. **Landing Page:** The user lands on the homepage, which displays the restaurant's name, logo, and a brief description. The menu is prominently displayed, allowing users to browse available items.
2. **Menu Browsing:** Users can navigate through different menu categories, view item details, and add items to their cart.
3. **Cart Management:** Users can view their cart, adjust quantities, and remove items. They can also proceed to checkout when ready.
4. **Checkout:** Users provide their contact information, delivery address (if applicable), and payment details. They can choose a delivery or pickup option.
5. **Order Confirmation:** After placing the order, users receive an order confirmation with details about their order, including order number, total price, and estimated delivery time (if applicable).
6. **Order Tracking:** Users can track the status of their order through a dedicated page or section within the app.

#### Constraints and Business Rules

* **Menu Updates:** The menu should be updated regularly to reflect any changes in availability or pricing.
* **Order Processing:** Orders should be processed efficiently and accurately, with timely updates to the user about the order status.

The application will be a web application built using the following technologies:

* **Frontend:** React with Styled Components
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express framework
* **Database:** MongoDB

#### Architecture

* **Frontend:** The frontend will handle user interactions, displaying the menu, cart, checkout process, and order tracking information. It will communicate with the backend API to fetch data and submit orders.
* **Backend:** The backend API will handle data storage, order processing, payment integration, and delivery integration (if applicable). It will communicate with the frontend to provide data and receive user actions.
* **Database:** MongoDB will store data related to the menu, orders, users, and other relevant information.

### Integration Specification

#### Payment Gateway

The application will integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process payments securely. The integration will involve sending payment information to the gateway and receiving payment confirmation.

#### Delivery Service (Optional)

If delivery is offered, the application will integrate with a delivery service provider (e.g., DoorDash, Uber Eats) to handle order fulfillment and tracking. The integration will involve sending order details to the delivery service and receiving updates on the order status.

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery or pickup information, and select a payment method.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery or pickup information, including name, address, phone number, and any special instructions. Users will also need to select a payment method. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** Redirect the user to the back-end system for payment processing.

### Example API Calls

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and select a payment method.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. Users will also need to select a payment method. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** Redirect the user to the back-end system for payment processing.

### Example API Calls

**Menu Retrieval:**

```json
GET /api/menu
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Appetizers",
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "Chicken Wings",

          "price": 10.99
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Order Placement:**

```json
POST /api/order
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Chicken Wings",
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "Burger",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "delivery_address": "123 Main Street",
  "payment_method": "CreditCard"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "order_id": "1234567890"
}
```

**Payment Processing:**

The front-end will redirect the user to the back-end system for payment processing. The back-end system will handle the payment details and return the user to the front-end with a confirmation message.

### Notes

* The front-end will be designed to be responsive and work on all devices.
* The front-end will be built using best practices for accessibility and performance.
* The front-end will be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is functional and meets the requirements of the specification.
* The front-end will include input validation and error handling to ensure that user input is correct and that the website is robust.

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and confirm their order.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** The front-end will not handle payment processing as all food is free.

### Example API Calls

**Menu Retrieval:**

```json
GET /api/menu
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {

3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and confirm their order.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** The front-end will not handle payment processing as all food is free.

### Example API Calls

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and confirm their order.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. The checkout page will clearly state that all food is free and that no payment is required. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** The front-end will not handle payment processing as all food is free.

### Example API Calls

**Menu Retrieval:**

```json
GET /api/menu
```

**Response:**

```json

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and confirm their order.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. The checkout page will clearly state that all food is free and that no payment is required. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.
* The restaurant will handle deliveries directly, without using any third-party delivery services. The details of the delivery process are not relevant to the website's functionality.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** The front-end will not handle payment processing as all food is free.

### Example API Calls

**Menu Retrieval:**

```json
GET /api/menu
```

**Response:**

```json

  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Appetizers",

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and confirm their order.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. The checkout page will clearly state that all food is free and that no payment is required. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.
* The restaurant will handle deliveries directly, without using any third-party delivery services. The details of the delivery process are not relevant to the website's functionality.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** The front-end will not handle payment processing as all food is free.

### Example API Calls

**Menu Retrieval:**

```json
GET /api/menu
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Appetizers",

          "price": 10.99
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "delivery_address": "123 Main Street"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "order_id": "1234567890"
}
```

### Notes

* The front-end will be designed to be responsive and work on all devices.
* The front-end will be built using best practices for accessibility and performance.
* The front-end will be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is functional and meets the requirements of the specification.
* The front-end will include input validation and error handling to ensure that user input is correct and that the website is robust.
* The checkout page will only require the user to enter their delivery address. No other personal information, such as name or phone number, will be required.
* The website will not use a third-party address validation service. The front-end will rely on user input for the delivery address.
* The restaurant will handle deliveries directly, without using any third-party delivery services. The details of the delivery process are not relevant to the website's functionality.
* The website will not provide any order confirmation or delivery updates to the user.

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and confirm their order.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. The checkout page will clearly state that all food is free and that no payment is required. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.
* The restaurant will handle deliveries directly, without using any third-party delivery services. The details of the delivery process are not relevant to the website's functionality.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** The front-end will not handle payment processing as all food is free.

## Food Ordering Website - Front-End Specification

### Overview

This specification outlines the front-end development for a food ordering website for a single restaurant. The website will be built using ReactJS and styled-components for styling. The front-end will be designed to be easily integrated with a back-end system that will handle user authentication, menu management, order processing, and payment processing.

### Features

* **Menu Browsing:** Users should be able to browse the restaurant's menu, view item descriptions, and see prices.
* **Item Selection:** Users should be able to select items from the menu and add them to a shopping cart.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to view the items in their shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items.
* **Checkout:** Users should be able to proceed to checkout, enter their delivery address, and confirm their order.

### Functional Specification

#### User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The website will display a landing page with the restaurant's name, logo, and possibly a brief description. Users can navigate to the menu from this page.
2.  **Menu Page:** The menu page will display a list of food categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts). Clicking on a category will display the items within that category. Each item will have a description, price, and an option to add it to the cart.
3.  **Shopping Cart:** Users can access the shopping cart from the menu page or a dedicated cart icon. The cart will display a list of selected items, their quantities, and the total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove items from the cart.
4.  **Checkout:** Clicking on the "Checkout" button will take the user to the checkout page. The checkout page will require the user to enter their delivery address. The checkout page will display the final order summary, including the total price. The checkout page will not require any payment information as all food is free. The checkout page will clearly state that all food is free and that no payment is required. After confirming the order, the user will receive no further confirmation or updates.

#### Constraints

* The website will be for a single restaurant, so the menu will be static and will not require dynamic updates.
* The website will not handle user authentication or payment processing. These functionalities will be handled by the back-end system.
* Users can order food anonymously, only requiring a delivery address.
* All food is free, so the checkout process will not require any payment information.
* Users will not receive any order confirmation or delivery updates.
* The restaurant will handle deliveries directly, without using any third-party delivery services. The details of the delivery process are not relevant to the website's functionality.

### Technical Specification

* **Framework:** ReactJS
* **Styling:** Styled-components
* **Architecture:** The front-end will be a single-page application (SPA) built using React components. The application will communicate with the back-end system via API calls to handle user authentication, menu retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.

### Integration Specification

* **Back-End Integration:** The front-end will communicate with the back-end system via API calls. The specific API endpoints and data formats will be defined by the back-end system. The front-end will handle the following API calls:
    * **Menu Retrieval:** Fetch the restaurant's menu data from the back-end.
    * **Order Placement:** Send the user's order details to the back-end for processing.
    * **Payment Processing:** The front-end will not handle payment processing as all food is free.

### Example API Calls

**Menu Retrieval:**

```json
GET /api/menu
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Appetizers",

    {
      "name": "Main Courses",

          "price": 10.99
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Order Placement:**

```

**Request Body:**

```json

  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Chicken Wings",
      "quantity": 2
    },

  ],
  "delivery_address": "123 Main Street"
}
```

**Response:**

## Frontend Specification

A simple hotel website with a static menu for food ordering.

The website will have the following pages:

* **Home page:**
    * Displays a brief description of the hotel (e.g., location, amenities, contact information).
    * Links to the food menu and contact page.
    * Will be implemented as a React component with a simple layout, including paragraphs of text and links to other pages.
* **Food menu page:**
    * Displays a static menu of the hotel's restaurant. 
    * The menu will only feature one type of pizza, with no variations.
    * Users can submit their order (with their name and phone number) for pickup or delivery.
    * The order submission form will not allow users to select a specific time for pickup or delivery.
    * The menu items (in this case, only one pizza) will be hardcoded into the React component. The website will display the menu items on the page. The order submission form will be handled by a React component, collecting user name and phone number and sending this data to the backend API. The user will not receive any confirmation of their order after submitting it.
* **Contact page:**
    * Displays the hotel's phone number (0771234567).
    * Will be implemented as a React component with a simple layout, displaying the hotel's phone number.

The website will be built using the following technologies:

* **Frontend:** ReactJS framework, styled-components for styling, and vanilla JavaScript.

The website will not have any user authentication or registration functionality, images or videos. The website will have a basic design with no specific color scheme or font preferences.

In `src/components/FoodMenuPage.jsx`, implement the `FoodMenuPage` component. The component should display a static menu of the hotel's restaurant, which includes only one type of pizza. The menu items should be hardcoded into the component. The component should also include an order submission form that allows users to submit their name and phone number for pickup or delivery. The form should not allow users to select a specific time for pickup or delivery. The form should be handled by a React component, collecting user name and phone number and sending this data to the backend API (which is not implemented in this example). The user will not receive any confirmation of their order after submitting it. The `FoodMenuPage` component should be styled using `styled-components` to match the basic design requirements. The component should be tested to ensure that it renders correctly and that the form submits the data correctly.

You are a DevOps engineer and you have been given a task to install all the dependencies for a project.
the project is a react vite project ans the architecht has listed the dependencies as follows:
---------start-of-dependencies---------------- 
[{'name': 'react', 'description': 'JavaScript library for building user interfaces'}, {'name': 'react-dom', 'description': 'React library for rendering components to the DOM'}, {'name': 'styled-components', 'description': 'CSS-in-JS library for styling React components'}, {'name': 'vite', 'description': 'Fast development server and build tool for React'}]
---------end-of-dependencies----------------
You need to provide all the correct npm commands to execute in linux environment to install **ALL** the dependencies for the project by referring to the `package.json` file given below.
---------start-of-package.json----------------
{'name': 'hondahitha hotels', 'private': True, 'version': '0.0.0', 'type': 'module', 'scripts': {'dev': 'vite', 'build': 'vite build', 'lint': 'eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0', 'preview': 'vite preview'}, 'dependencies': {'react': '^18.2.0', 'react-dom': '^18.2.0'}, 'devDependencies': {'@types/react': '^18.2.64', '@types/react-dom': '^18.2.21', '@vitejs/plugin-react': '^4.2.1', 'eslint': '^8.57.0', 'eslint-plugin-react': '^7.34.0', 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks': '^4.6.0', 'eslint-plugin-react-refresh': '^0.4.5', 'vite': '^5.1.6'}}
---------end-of-package.json----------------
The junior developer has provided some of the commands necesary to install the dependencies that he think are necessary.
-----------start-of-commands---------------------

-----------end-of-commands----------------------- 
However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

## Movie Search Website - Front-end Specification

### 1. Overall Description and Goals

The website will allow users to search for and view information about various movies. Users should be able to search for movies by title, genre, or actor. The website should display a list of search results, and users should be able to click on a movie to view more detailed information about it.

### 2. Features

* **Search:** Users can search for movies by title, genre, or actor.
* **Search Results:** The website displays a list of search results, showing the movie title, poster, and a brief synopsis.
* **Movie Details:** Clicking on a movie from the search results will display a detailed page with information about the movie, including title, poster, synopsis, cast, crew, release date, genre, rating, and user reviews.

### 3. Functional Specification

#### 3.1. Homepage

* The homepage will display a search bar for users to enter their search queries.
* The homepage will also display a list of popular movies, which can be dynamically updated based on user preferences or trending movies.

#### 3.2. Search Functionality

* Users can enter their search query in the search bar, which can be by title, genre, or actor.
* The website will display a list of search results that match the user's query.
* The search results will be displayed in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format.
* Users can click on a movie from the search results to view more detailed information about it.

#### 3.3. Movie Details Page

* The movie details page will display all the relevant information about the movie, including title, poster, synopsis, cast, crew, release date, genre, rating, and user reviews.
* The movie details page will be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

### 4. Technical Specification

* **Frontend:** ReactJS with Styled Components for styling.
* **Data Source:** The website will fetch movie data from a third-party API (details to be provided by the client).

### 5. Integration Specification

* **Third-party API:** The website will integrate with a third-party API to fetch movie data. The client will provide the API documentation and access details. The API should provide endpoints for searching movies by title, genre, or actor, and for retrieving detailed information about a specific movie.

**Example API Request:**

```json
{
  "title": "The Shawshank Redemption"
}
```

**Example API Response:**

```json
{
  "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
  "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/q6y0Go1tsGEsmtFryDOJo3dEmqu.jpg",
  "synopsis": "Two imprisoned men bond over a period of two decades, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.",
  "cast": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
  "crew": ["Frank Darabont", "Stephen King"],
  "release_date": "1994-09-23",
  "genre": ["Drama"],
  "rating": 9.3
}
```

**Note:** The client will provide the exact API endpoints, authentication details, and data format. The developer will use this information to integrate the API into the website.

* **Third-party API:** The website will integrate with a third-party API to fetch movie data. The client will provide the API documentation and access details. The API should provide endpoints for searching movies by title, genre, or actor, and for retrieving detailed information about a specific movie.

**Example API Request:**

```json
{
  "title": "The Shawshank Redemption"
}
```

**Example API Response:**

```json
{
  "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
  "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/q6y0Go1tsGEsmtFryDOJo3dEmqu.jpg",
  "synopsis": "Two imprisoned men bond over a period of two decades, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.",
  "cast": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
  "crew": ["Frank Darabont", "Stephen King"],
  "release_date": "1994-09-23",
  "genre": ["Drama"],
  "rating": 9.3
}
```

**Note:** The client will provide the exact API endpoints, authentication details, and data format. The developer will use this information to integrate the API into the website.

You are a DevOps engineer and you have been given a task to install all the dependencies for a project.
the project is a react vite project ans the architecht has listed the dependencies as follows:
---------start-of-dependencies---------------- 
- react : JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- react-dom : React library for rendering components to the DOM
- styled-components : CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- vite : Fast development server and build tool for React
---------end-of-dependencies----------------
You need to provide all the correct npm commands to execute in linux environment to install **ALL** the dependencies for the project by referring to the `package.json` file given below.

---------end-of-package.json----------------

However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

You are a DevOps engineer and you have been given a task to install all the dependencies for a project.
the project is a react vite project ans the architecht has listed the dependencies as follows:
---------start-of-dependencies---------------- 
- react : JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- react-dom : React library for rendering components to the DOM
- styled-components : CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- vite : Fast development server and build tool for React
---------end-of-dependencies----------------
You need to provide all the correct npm commands to execute in linux environment to install **ALL** the dependencies for the project by referring to the `package.json` file given below.

---------end-of-package.json----------------

However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

This should be replaced with the actual API key.\n2. **Missing Movie Details Component:** The `MovieDetails` component is not implemented, so the `/movie/:movieId` route will not work.\n3. **Missing Genre and Actor Search:** The task description asks for search by genre and actor, but the code only implements search by title. The `handleSearch` function should be updated to support these additional search parameters.\n4. **Missing Error Handling:** The `handleSearch` function doesn't handle errors properly. It should display an error message to the user if the API call fails.\n5. **Missing Pagination:** The search results should be paginated to handle large result sets.\n6. **Missing Styling:** The code doesn't include any styling for the search results or movie details. The developer should add basic styling to make the UI more user-friendly.\n\nOverall, the hunk is a good start, but needs some improvements to meet the requirements of the task description. The developer should address the issues mentioned above before merging the changes."}

You are a DevOps engineer and you have been given a task to install all the dependencies for a project.
the project is a react vite project ans the architecht has listed the dependencies as follows:
---------start-of-dependencies---------------- 
- react : JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- styled-components : CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- axios : Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
---------end-of-dependencies----------------
You need to provide all the correct npm commands to execute in linux environment to install **ALL** the dependencies for the project by referring to the `package.json` file given below.

    }
}
---------end-of-package.json----------------
The junior developer has provided some of the commands necesary to install the dependencies that he think are necessary.
-----------start-of-commands---------------------





-----------end-of-commands----------------------- 
However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

You are a DevOps engineer and you have been given a task to install all the dependencies for a project.
the project is a react vite project ans the architecht has listed the dependencies as follows:
---------start-of-dependencies---------------- 
- react : JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- react-dom : React library for rendering components to the DOM
- styled-components : CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- vite : Fast development server and build tool for React
---------end-of-dependencies----------------
You need to provide all the correct npm commands to execute in linux environment to install **ALL** the dependencies for the project by referring to the `package.json` file given below.
---------start-of-package.json----------------
{
    "name": "hondahitha-movies",
    "private": true,
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview",
        "lint": "eslint src"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "axios": "^1.4.0",
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "@types/react": "^18.0.15",
        "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.6",
        "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^3.1.0",
        "eslint": "^8.38.0",
        "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.32.2",
        "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.6.0",
        "vite": "^4.3.9"
    }
}
---------end-of-package.json----------------

However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

You are a DevOps engineer and you have been given a task to install all the dependencies for a project.
the project is a react vite project ans the architecht has listed the dependencies as follows:
---------start-of-dependencies---------------- 
- react : JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- react-dom : React library for rendering components to the DOM
- styled-components : CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- vite : Fast development server and build tool for React
---------end-of-dependencies----------------
You need to provide all the correct npm commands to execute in linux environment to install **ALL** the dependencies for the project by referring to the `package.json` file given below.
---------start-of-package.json----------------
{
    "name": "hondahitha-movies",
    "private": true,
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview",
        "lint": "eslint src"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "axios": "^1.4.0",
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "@types/react": "^18.0.15",
        "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.6",
        "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^3.1.0",
        "eslint": "^8.38.0",
        "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.32.2",
        "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.6.0",
        "vite": "^4.3.9"
    }
}
---------end-of-package.json----------------

However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

# Hondahitha Movies

This project is a simple movie search website built with ReactJS. Users can search for movies by title, genre, or actor, and view detailed information about each movie.

## Overview

The application is a single-page application (SPA) built with ReactJS. The frontend handles all user interactions and displays dynamic content. The application does not require a backend server or database, as all data is hardcoded into the React components. The frontend is built using ReactJS, styled-components for styling, and vanilla JavaScript. The application will be deployed to a static hosting service, such as Netlify or Vercel.

## Features

- **Search:** Users can search for movies by title, genre, or actor.
- **Search Results:** The website displays a list of search results, showing the movie title, poster, and a brief synopsis.
- **Movie Details:** Clicking on a movie from the search results will display a detailed page with information about the movie, including title, poster, synopsis, cast, crew, release date, genre, rating, and user reviews.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

However some of the commands provided by the junior developer may be syntactically incorrect you may discard the ones you think to be incorrect.
This is important the the package.json file, commands provided by the junior developer and the package dependencies given by the architect can be incomplete.
Therefore when you are providing the commands consider the union of the dependencies in the package.json file and the dependencies given by the architect and provide the commands to install **all** the dependencies.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

# hondahitha movies
"Hondahitha Movies" is a project that aims to provide a comprehensive platform for movie enthusiasts. It offers a wide range of features, including movie recommendations, reviews, and a user-friendly interface for discovering new films. 


## overview

The application will be a single-page application (SPA) built with ReactJS. The frontend will handle all user interactions and display dynamic content. The application will not require a backend server or database, as all data will be hardcoded into the React components. The frontend will be built using ReactJS, styled-components for styling, and vanilla JavaScript. The application will be deployed to a static hosting service, such as Netlify or Vercel.


## package dependencies

- react : JavaScript library for building user interfaces

- react-dom : React library for rendering components to the DOM

- styled-components : CSS-in-JS library for styling React components

- vite : Fast development server and build tool for React


## system dependencies

- Node.js : JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.



## Quick setup
- Please run the following commands to setup the project in the terminal on the same directory as the project root folder.
- Root folder is the folder where the package.json file is located.
```

npm install react react-dom styled-components vite axios @types/react @types/react-dom @vitejs/plugin-react eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks

```
- And to start the project run the following command in the same terminal
```
npm run dev
```
