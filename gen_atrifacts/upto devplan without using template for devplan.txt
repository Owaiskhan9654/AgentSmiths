The website will display the menu items on the page. The order submission form will be handled by a React component, collecting user name and phone number and sending this data to the backend API. The user will not receive any confirmation of their order after submitting it.\n* **Contact page:** The contact page will be a React component with a simple layout, displaying the hotel's phone number.\n\nThe website will not have any user authentication or registration functionality, images or videos. The website will have a basic design with no specific color scheme or font preferences. \n",
